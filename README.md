## Description of subsets

**1.  `model/features`**

File format: `YYYYMMDD.nc` (`YYYY`: year, `MM`: month, `DD`: day in the month)

Time Period: From 2020 to 2023, only the freezing season (18 Oct. to 15 Apr.)

Contains pairs of low-resolution/high-resolution fields from the NeXtSIM simulation. The dataset generation is described in this document. The fields are listed here

| Dimensions | y = 1086 ; x = 1308 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|

| Variable               | Dimensions  | Description                              |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `time`                 | -           | Time in days since 2022-01-12 00:00:00   |
| `longitude`            | (y, x)    | Longitude in degrees east                |
| `latitude`             | (y, x)    | Latitude in degrees north                |
| `sic`                  | (y, x)    | Sea Ice Concentration                    |
| `sic_reprocessed`      | (y, x)    | Reprocessed Sea Ice Concentration        |
| `sit`                  | (y, x)    | Sea Ice Thickness                        |
| `sit_reprocessed`      | (y, x)    | Reprocessed Sea Ice Thickness            |
| `divergence`           | (y, x)    | Divergence of sea ice motion             |
| `divergence_reprocessed` | (y, x)  | Reprocessed Divergence of sea ice motion |
| `shear`                | (y, x)    | Shear of sea ice motion                  |
| `shear_reprocessed`    | (y, x)    | Reprocessed Shear of sea ice motion      |

**2.  `model/predictions`**

File format: `sit_hrai_YYYYMMDD.nc` (`YYYY`: year, `MM`: month, `DD`: day in the month)

Time Period: From 2020 to 2023, only the freezing season (18 Oct. to 15 Apr.) matching dates in `model/features`

Contains ensemble (size n=30) of high-resolution fields generated by the diffusion model. The AI algorithm is described in this document. 

The fields are listed here

| Dimensions | y = 1086 ; x = 1308 ; n = 30 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|

| Variable               | Dimensions  | Description                              |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `time`                 | -           | Time in days since 2022-01-12 00:00:00   |
| `longitude`            | (y, x)      | Longitude in degrees east                |
| `latitude`             | (y, x)      | Latitude in degrees north                |
| `sit_ai`               | (n, y, x)   | Sea Ice Thickness generated by AI     |

The members of the ensemble are spanning the possible high-resolution samples from a unique set of low-resolution features.
